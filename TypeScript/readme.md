## TypeScript

### Basic Types

-   Type Annotation –
    learn how to use type annotation to define the static type for variables, function parameters, and return values.

-   Number
    learn about the numeric types including floating-point numbers and big integers.
-   String – show you how to use the string type in TypeScript.
-   Boolean – guide you on the boolean type and how to use it effectively.
-   Object Type – introduce you to the object type that represents - non-primitive values.
-   Array – show you how to use an array and its operations.
-   Tuple – learn how to store a fixed number of elements with known types in a tuple.
-   Enum – show you how to define a group of named constants by using enum type.
-   Any Type – learn how to use the any type to store a value of any type in a variable.
-   Void type – show you how to use the void type as the return type of - functions which do not return any value.
-   Never Type – learn how to use the never type that contains no value.
-   Union Types – guide you on how to store a value of one or several types in a variable with the union type.
-   Type Aliases – show you how to define new names for types using type aliases.
-   String Literal Types – learn how to define a type that accepts only a specified string literal.
-   Type Inference – explain where and how TypeScript infers types of variables.

### Control Flow Statements

-   if…else – learn how to execute code based on a condition.
-   switch..case – show you how to use the switch statement to allow a number of possible execution paths.
-   for – create a loop that executes a specified number of times.
-   while – create a pretest loop that executes as long as a condition is true.
-   do…while – learn how to create a posttest loop that executes until a condition is false.
-   break – show you how to use the break statement to terminate a loop or a switch.
-   continue – learn how to skip to the end of a loop and continue the next iteration

### Functions

-   Functions – learn how to declare a function that uses type annotation in TypeScript.
-   Function types – guide you on how to use function types to define types for functions.
-   Optional Parameters – show you how to define functions with optional parameters.
-   Default Parameters – introduce you to default parameters.
-   Rest Parameters – use the rest parameters to handle an infinite number of arguments of a function.
-   Function overloadings – learn how to establish between parameter types and results of a function via function overloadings.

### Classes

-   Classes – learn how to construct a class in TypeScript.
-   Access Modifiers – introduce you to private, protected, and public access modifiers.
-   The readonly Modifier – learn how to use the readonly modifier to make class properties immutable.
-   Getters & Setters – show you how to use the getters and setters to control the access of the class properties.
-   Inheritance – learn how to use the inheritance to reuse the functionality of another class.
-   Static methods & properties – define static methods and variables shared by all instances of a class.
-   Abstract Classes – explain the abstract classes that define some common behaviors

### Interfaces

-   Interfaces – introduce you to interfaces and how to use them for creating contracts within your code.
-   Extending Interfaces – learn how to extend an interface to create a combination of interfaces.

### Advanced Types

-   Intersection Types – show you how to create a new type that has all features of existing types.
-   Type Guards – learn how to use type guards to narrow the type of a variable within a conditional block.
-   Type Casting – show you how to use type casting to convert a variable of one type to another.
-   Type Assertions – guide you on how to use a type assertion to tell the compiler to treat a value as a specified type.

### Generics

-   Introduction to TypeScript Generics – learn how to use TypeScript generics to develop generic functions.
-   Generic constraints – show you how to add constraints to the generic types.
-   Generic Classes – guide you on how to develop generic classes.
-   Generic Interfaces – walk you through the steps for creating generic interfaces.

### Modules

-   TypeScript Modules – introduce you to modules in TypeScript and how to use them in other modules.

### TypeScript in Node.js

-   Node.js TypeScript – how to set up a development environment for using TypeScript in the Node.js project.
